# New Server Setup

The following scripts are created during a bash scripting lesson.  The goal is to become more comfortable with the initial setup of a Ubuntu server and learn basic bash commands.

## Goals

Let's make a script to update a newly provisioned server and set it up for a limited user.  First you want to update the system:

`apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade`

You don't need to use sudo as you will be running this script as root on your first log in to the machine.

Working on this.
